# MatrixSumAndProduct

This project is a C++ application that performs matrix operations. It allows the user to display matrices, calculate their sum, product, and power, and also compute the sum of powers, and more through an interactive menu.

## Features

1. Display matrix M
2. Display matrix M3 (Sum of matrices)
3. Display matrix M4 (Product of matrices)
4. Display result (Matrix power)
5. Display S (Sum of powers)

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can download and install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or use any C++ IDE like [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or [Dev-C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed:
- GCC (or MinGW for Windows)
- Any C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Dev-C++)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ton-username/MatrixSumAndProduct.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MatrixSumAndProduct
    ```

3. Compile and run the `projet_matrice.cpp` file:

    ```bash
    g++ projet_matrice.cpp -o matrix_operations
    ./matrix_operations
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted with a menu:
